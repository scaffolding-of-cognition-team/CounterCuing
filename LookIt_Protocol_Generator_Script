We wanted to measure how long it takes your child to reorient their gaze to the spinning pinwheel, after their attention was (maybe) grabbed by the green triangle on the other side of the screen. We expect that most babies will get faster at reorienting their gaze as they learn that the shapes appear on opposite sides of the screen in a predictable way. This won't be true for all babies, potentially because they were already responding quickly, and a goal of this study is learning about how many babies show this trend. Additionally, in the babies that show this trend, we are interested in knowing how many trials it takes for them to learn this.",
